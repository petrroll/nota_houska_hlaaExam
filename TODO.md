- Do push differently: mass all types of units -> move them at once / artillery first
    - do high DPS targeting 

- fix retreat for general keepOnLane sensor
    - update moveCommand so that it can handle adding / removing units & run in a loop
    - have two on-reapeat move commands that move chaning sets of units out of danger & to goal loc

- self-destruct behaviour for lane pushing on spy
- better targeting for units of all types
